## **7. Our legal grounds for processing Personal Information**
We may only process your Personal Information if we have a legal basis for doing so. This section sets out the legal grounds on which we rely in order to process your Personal Information.

We consider that the legal bases for using your Personal Information are as follows:

- use of your Personal Information is necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you (for example, to comply with our Terms of Use which you accept by browsing the Site or by downloading the App);
- our use of your Personal Information is necessary for complying with our legal obligations;
- where neither of the above two legal bases applies, use of your Personal Information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (for example, to ensure the security of the Site or App). Our legitimate interests are:
  - to run, grow and develop our business;
  - to operate and secure the Site and App;
  - marketing, market research and business development;
  - to provide the Tassie Services to our users, to provide customer and technical services and to know the users that we are providing the Tassie Services to;
  - to protect our users and Our Group from fraud or harm; and
  - for internal group administrative purposes.

If we rely on our (or a third party’s) legitimate interests for using your Personal Information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the third party’s) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of your Personal Information. You can ask us for information on this balancing test by contacting us.

Other uses of Personal Information (including special categories of Personal Information and participation in the beta programme) may be subject to your consent (which you may withdraw at any time after giving it).

If we rely on your consent for us to use your Personal Information in a particular way, but you later change your mind, you may withdraw your consent by contacting us and we will stop doing so. However, if you withdraw your consent, this may impact the ability for us to provide services to you.
## **8. Where is your Personal Information stored and processed?**
We will process and store your Personal Information in the locations in which Our Group operates, and in the location of our servers.

We comply with applicable laws in respect of the international transfer of Personal Information.
## **9. How long do we keep your Personal Information?**
We will not keep your Personal Information longer than reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as prescribed by law. In particular, we will implement a retention policy which stipulates the length of time we keep Personal Information. We will securely delete the Personal Information that we no longer need, and update, archive or securely delete Personal Information if it goes out of date. Therefore, we will retain any personal data related to your account for as long as you keep it open.

We do not retain the contact information you provide about others for matching purposes after we have performed the matching.

We keep daily backups of the Site which will automatically be deleted after 60 days, and a monthly backup which will allow us to keep a record of how the Site appears each month (both of which will include Personal Information) and which we will keep for 6 years, in each case for the purposes of maintaining the Site, and establishing, exercising or defending our legal rights. We put measures in place to ensure that any Personal Information which is stored on our backup systems is put “beyond all reasonable use”. That means that we cannot and will not use that Personal Information to inform any decision about you or in a manner that affects you in any way, or give any other organisation access to that Personal Information. It also means that, when you exercise any of your rights in relation to your Personal Information, any Personal Information which is stored on our backup systems will not necessarily be within scope of those rights (i.e. we will not usually disclose it in response to a request for access to Personal Information, nor will we usually need to erase it should you ask us to). Should you exercise any of your rights in relation to your Personal Information, we will explain – in our response – how those rights apply in relation to Personal Information which is stored in our backup systems.

The length of time we retain Personal Information for depends on the purposes for which we collect and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws and to establish, exercise of defend our legal rights.
## **10. How do we secure your Personal Information?**
We take steps in an effort to treat your information securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately though, the internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure and, as such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted to the Site or the App and that such transmission is at your own risk.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access your online account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
## **11. What about the privacy of children?**
We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use Personal Information from children under the age of 16, and no part of the Tassie Service is directed to children under the age of 16. If you learn that your child has provided us with Personal Information without your consent, you may alert us. If we learn that we have collected any Personal Information from children under 16, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the child’s account.
## **12. Changes to this Privacy Policy**
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on our Site or App. Depending on the significance of the changes, we may get in touch with you or display a more prominent notice. If we need to, we will e-mail you with details of those changes and/or ask you to confirm that you are happy with them. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy.

**13. Your rights**
